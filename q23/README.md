<p><h3><strong>Q23.Conditional Tests:</strong></h3>Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:<strong><br>let car = 'subaru';<br>console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")<br>console.log(car == 'subaru')</strong>
<ul>
<li>Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.</li>
<li>Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.</li>
</ul>
</p>
