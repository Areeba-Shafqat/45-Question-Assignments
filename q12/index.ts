// 12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names: string[] = ["Aqsa", "Muqaddus", "Iqra", "Amna", "Khadija"];
names.forEach((allName) => {
  console.log(`\n${allName}! Would You Like To Studies Again In School?`);
});
