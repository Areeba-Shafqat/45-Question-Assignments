// 45. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function makeCar(
  manufacturer: string,
  model: string,
  ...options: [string, any][]
) {
  let car = { manufacturer, model };
  options.forEach(([key, value]) => {
    car[key] = value;
  });
  return car;
}
console.log(makeCar("Toyota", "Corolla", ["color", "red"], ["year", 2022]));
console.log(makeCar("Ford", "Fiesta", ["color", "blue"], ["sunroof", true]));
