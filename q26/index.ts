// 26. Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and
// write an if-else chain.

// • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

// • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

// Question 25
let alien_color: string = "green";

// version that runs if block
if (alien_color === "green") {
  console.log("You Just Earned 5 Points For Shooting The Alien.");
} else {
  console.log("You Just Earned 10 Points For Shooting The Alien.");
}

//version that runs else block
alien_color = "red";
if (alien_color === "green") {
  console.log("You Just Earned 5 Points For Shooting The Alien.");
} else {
  console.log("You Just Earned 10 Points For Shooting The Alien.");
}
